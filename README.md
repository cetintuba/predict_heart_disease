Predict Heart Disease is predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical data.

The dataset includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate.
Different machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to find the best model for prediction.

The goal of this project is to help understand how machine learning can be used in healthcare for early risk detection and decision support.
